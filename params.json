{"name":"Rap-green","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/rap-green","body":"RAP-Green is a new implementation and an improvment of the RAP software (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/RAP/RAP.htm), which permits to compare gene and species trees, infers duplication events, and provide confidence score in function conservation between genes.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, it became a development plateform, to implement several phylogenetic tree analysis softwares.\r\n\r\nRAP-Green includes also two graphical web interfaces : one to display phylogenetic trees, explore them and annotate them ; and another to explore a tree forest, using tree pattern matching, and a tree pattern daemon implemented in the Rap-Green java package.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n*PLEASE CITE:*\r\n\r\nhttp://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/11/2596.short\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n*CONTACT*\r\n\r\nFor general questions or comments, you can contact the project owner (jeanfrancois.dufayard _at_ gmail.com)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n*ABOUT TREE PATTERN MATCHING*\r\n\r\nTree pattern matching is a way to explore a large library of phylogenetic trees, extracting those which contain specific phylogenetic patterns.\r\n\r\nTree pattern matching facilities are in constant development, and are not intended to be easily installed and adapted to a tree repository. The installation of this system in your environment should be the occasion of a collaboration. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n*ABOUT TREE RECONCILIATION:*\r\n\r\nDocumentation is yet to be improved.\r\n\r\nFor a command line option description:\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/rap-green/wiki/CommandLineDocumentation\r\n\r\nFor a code documentation: \r\n\r\nhttp://rap-green.googlecode.com/svn/doc/index.html\r\n\r\nIssues ares managed from another system hosted by the CIRAD, but the issue manager here can be used as a public entry point.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n*NEWS:*\r\n\r\n06/06/2014: adding NHX output in version 57\r\n\r\n18/11/2013: bug solving concerning midpoint rooting, and a lack of precision, in version 54\r\n\r\n15/07/2013: new stable version of tree pattern matching facilities, in version 47\r\n\r\n04/06/2013: solving a label bug with rerooting procedures, fixed in version 44\r\n\r\n27/05/2013: web interfaces added.\r\n\r\n27/03/2013: a lot of new executable classes and improvements.\r\n\r\n20/06/2012: several bug solving, and improvements.\r\n\r\n12/09/2011: Adding an option to integrate outparalogous genes in statistic and phyloXML files. Added in RapGreen_28.jar.\r\n\r\n11/28/2011: Adding rerooting facilities.\r\n\r\n10/12/2011: Adding some experimental tools.\r\n\r\n09/27/2011: bug correction on rerooting operation. Fatal issue if the gene tree is already rooted, on a leaf. Solved in RapGreen_18.jar.\r\n\r\n09/20/2011: bug correction on branch reduction. Some very rare dead-end issues occurred. Solved in RapGreen_17.jar.\r\n\r\n08/10/2011: new featured version, integration of PhyloXML standard and sequence relationships.\r\n\r\n08/05/2011: project opening. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nProject was formerly supported by [Helix INRIA project](http://www-helix.inrialpes.fr/old/), and [LBBE](http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/), and is now supported by the [UMR AGAP](http://umr-agap.cirad.fr/) ([CIRAD](http://www.cirad.fr)) and project [Ancestrome](http://ancestrome.univ-lyon1.fr/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
