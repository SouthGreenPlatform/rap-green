## Welcome to the rap-green project !

For a full documentation, please visit the RapGreen wiki:
https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/rap-green/wiki

You'll find there the command lines documentation of the two main entry points of the RapGreen Java package, and tutorials to install the main webservices : the tree pattern matching, and the tree viewer.

If you plan to:

* Use RapGreen tree reconciler, in order to annote duplication and losses on a phylogenetic tree, please follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/rap-green/wiki/How-to-use-RapGreen-to-reconcile-phylogenetic-trees). You could also get at look at the [statistics](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/rap-green/wiki/About-gene-pair-statistics) given by RapGreen for each pair of genes of the reconciled phylogenetic tree.

* Install the tree pattern matching service on your own data, please follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/rap-green/wiki/How-to-install-a-phylogenetic-tree-pattern-matching-service).

* Install the tree display service InTreeGreat [this tutorial](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/rap-green/wiki/How-to-install-the-tree-visualizator-InTreeGreat).

The general API Java documentation of the RapGreen package is available [here](http://southgreenplatform.github.io/rap-green/javadoc/index.html).

RapGreen is used by several systems and platforms. Some examples are available [here](https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/rap-green/wiki/Examples-of-installed-services).
