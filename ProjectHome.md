RAP-Green is a new implementation and an improvment of the RAP software (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/RAP/RAP.htm), which permits to compare gene and species trees, infers duplication events, and provide confidence score in function conservation between genes.

Afterwards, it became a development plateform, to implement several phylogenetic tree analysis softwares.

RAP-Green includes also two graphical web interfaces : one to display phylogenetic trees, explore them and annotate them ; and another to explore a tree forest, using tree pattern matching, and a tree pattern daemon implemented in the Rap-Green java package.

**ABOUT TREE PATTERN MATCHING**

Tree pattern matching is a way to explore a large library of phylogenetic trees, extracting those which contain specific phylogenetic patterns.

Tree pattern matching facilities are in constant development, and are not intended to be easily installed and adapted to a tree repository. The installation of this system in your environment should be the occasion of a collaboration.
